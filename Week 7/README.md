# Week 7 Assignment - CV - Brightness Mirror Exploration

I chose the Brightness Mirror sketch to work with for this assignment. I began by commenting out lines to see what changed. I then spent some time trying to understand the nested loop, which I believe is making the grid of pixel squares, and telling them how to respond based on the intensity of the light received through the camera.

I tried adjusting things within that loop, but it mostly crashed the program or didn't lead to anything interesting. 

In the end, I changed the squares to circles, and played with colors and size. I added outlines of light gray to the circles, which for me added more texture/detail to the "reflection". I wrote in a line that makes the circles cycle through colors randomly, which creates a disco-ball effect (commented it out for the submission, but available for play).
